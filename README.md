# Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

### Caesar Cipher:
  - The `Caesar Cipher` is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
  - For example, with a shift of 3:
    - A becomes D
    - B becomes E
    - C becomes F
    - and so on ...    
  - The Caesar Cipher is considered a `symmetric key encryption method`. This means that the same key (i.e shift value) is used for both encryption and decryption.
  - `Encryption`: The sender uses a key (or shift value) to `encrypt` the message.
  - `Decryption`: The receiver uses the same key as the sender to `decrypt` the message back to its original form.
