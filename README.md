# Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

### Caesar Cipher:
  - The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
  - For example, with a shift of 3:
    - A becomes D
    - B becomes E
    - C becomes F
    - and so on ...
